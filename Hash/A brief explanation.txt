The seek algorithm of typical data increases average navigation time as the number of data grows. 
However, Hash is a data structure that ensures that all data is searched for the same amount of time regardless of the size of the data. 
Therefore, the hash is mainly used for applications where the amount of data is handled and the search speed is critical. 
The search / insert of the data in the hash goes through the following process :

1. Attain the k value k through the content of the material
2. Using hash value k for index, search a data or store a data in spicific location.(e.g., search/store tablek[k])
3. If data is already stored in the table[k], apply the algorithm to locate the appropriate position in the table and store the data in there.
